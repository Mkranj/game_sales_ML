# Game sales prediction
Predicting game sales based on attributes of individual games, such as which and how many consoles it released on, when was it released, genre, and several features relating to game titles.
E.g. does it appear that games with subtitles, and especially those with more than one subtitle, sell less?  

Main analysis in the .RMD notebook.
